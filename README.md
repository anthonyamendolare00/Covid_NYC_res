# Covid_NYC_res
This program is through Google Colab, as with a CSV file I visualized the case count of Covid-19 cases in NYC residents, and the death versus the hospitalized case count in NYC residents. As well, I find the mean, median, and standard deviation to find the distribution. In addition, i find the death percentage of cases in NYC residents.
